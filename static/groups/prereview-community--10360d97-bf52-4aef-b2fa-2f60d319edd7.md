## Summary

[PREreview](https://prereview.org) is a platform, resource center and convener. We provide ways for feedback to preprints to be done openly, rapidly, constructively, and by a global community of peers.

Our mission is to bring more equity and transparency to scholarly peer review by supporting and empowering communities of researchers, particularly those at early stages of their career (ECRs) and historically excluded, to review preprints in a process that is rewarding to them.

PREreview is a fiscally sponsored project of the non-profit organization [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/).

## Evaluation model

The PREreview platform is a free and open-source website for the crowdsourcing of preprint reviews (PREreviews). 

As a registered user (PREreviewer), you are able to:

- Switch between Public and a unique Anonymous Persona for any public action your perform on the platform

- Request a PREreview on any preprint with a registered DOI

- Fill out a rapid PREreview—a structured form of 12 yes/no/not sure/n.a. questions designed to capture the essence of the preprint

- Compose a full PREreview—a text review report that upon submission is assigned a DOI via Zenodo

- Comment on others’ full PREreviews

- Endorse others’ full PREreviews via Plaudit.pub

- Report others’ full PREreviews as violating our Code of Conduct

- Join communities of like-minded reviewing groups

- Start your own community

As an unregistered user, you are able to:

- Search for preprints that have PREreviews or requests for PREreviews on the site

- Read and sort through aggregated rapid and full PREreviews alongside the preprint pdf (if available)

- Search through PREreviewers and view users’ profiles and contributions to preprint reviews and scholarship

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We ask all community members to agree our [Code of Conduct](https://content.prereview.org/coc) and disclose any competing interest at the time of PREreview submission.
